Open
- Figure out translate data mining results into D3
    - Map display with zipcode
        - Get data organized such that one giant DF, query just breed, gender, age, size info PER zipcode
    - Integrate breed data with map display
- Integrate dog SVG visualizations
- Interface data mining results with Flask
- Interface Flask with React
- Host on Heroku
- one hot encoding on dog breeds (keep in mind imbalance)
- check results on random forest classifier on all categorical attributes
    - make sure categorical data is true and False
    - make sure ordinal values are 1,2,3,4


Done
- Create script to call pet finder API from list of california zipcode and save data as dataframes
- Create mockup
- Pet Finder API interface
- Get just CA zipcode from zipcode database
- go through for each zipcode:
    - for dogs with 'adoptable' status:
        - find 3 top dog breeds
        - gender distribution
        - age distribution
        - sizes in order
- What variables impact whether Dog A gets adopted?
    - Fit a random forest and the outcome is 1 or 0
    - 1 being adopted or not
    - Naturally in random forest, top tree nodes are the most important
- Fix - What variables impact whether Dog A gets adopted? - oversampling issue by upsampling the adopted dogs
    - Weight the adopted ones at a ratio of 52/3 more dict{1:52, 2:3}
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
        class_weight = dict({1:1.9, 2:35, 3:180})

- Get all zipcodes of SoCal data (90001 - 93199)
- Figure out translate data mining results into D3
    - Breed data display
- append all retrieved dataframes into one dataframe
- Map display with zipcode
    - Get list of availalbe zipcodes according to data mined
    - Get list of available breeds according to data mined
